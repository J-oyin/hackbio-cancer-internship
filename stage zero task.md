Differential expression; Upregulation and Downregulation

Introduction: Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used to synthesize a functional gene that gives rise to end products, such as proteins or non-coding RNA, and ultimately affects a phenotype. Genes are encoded by DNA, which can be subject to upregulation and downregulation by being transcribed to a messenger RNA and then translated to a protein. Downregulation and upregulation refer to the processes by which the expression of specific genes is decreased or increased, respectively.

Differential expression: This means variation in gene expression levels, between conditions, tissues, or developmental stages, i.e., different genes are activated in a cell, giving that cell a specific purpose that defines its function. It is a critical concept in molecular biology, particularly in studying how genes respond to changes in the environment, disease states, or developmental processes. It is extremely important because it allows living organisms, to grow and develop into complex, multicellular beings. When erroneous gene expressions happen to somatic cells, cancer, and other diseases may develop. A gene is declared differentially expressed if an observed difference or change in reading counts or expression levels between two experimental conditions is statistically significant (Anjun et al., 2016). To measure gene expression the sequencing readings obtained are aligned to a known reference and the proportion of reads matching a given transcript is used as quantification of its expression level followed by statistical testing of difference in quantification values between samples (bloom et al., 2009). 

Upregulation: This is a process that occurs within a cell triggered by a signal (internally or externally), which results in increased expression of one or more genes and, as a result, the proteins encoded by them. Upregulation is crucial for adaptation, allowing organisms to adjust to new environments. For example, when a cell is deficient in some kind of receptor, more receptor protein is synthesized and transported to the membrane of the cell, and, thus, the sensitivity of the cell is restored.

Downregulation: Downregulation of gene expression involves suppression of gene transcription and/or translation to a protein. This reduction can be a way for cells to conserve energy, reduce the production of unnecessary or harmful proteins, or adapt. Downregulation is also a key factor in disease development. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes may be downregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.
